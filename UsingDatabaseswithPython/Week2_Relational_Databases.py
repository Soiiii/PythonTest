# Relational Databases
# Relational databases model data by storing rows and columns in tables
# The power of the relational database lies in its ability to efficiently
# retrieve data from those tables and in particular where there are multiple
# tables and the relationships between those tables involved in the query

# Terminology
# Database - contains many tables
# Relation ( or table ) - contains tuples and attributes
# Tuple ( or row ) - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track
# Attribute ( also column or field ) - one of possibly many elements of data corresponding
# to the object represented by the row

# A relation is defined as a set of tuples that have the same attributes.
# A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object.
# Objects are typically physical objects or concepts.
# A relation is usually described as a table, which is organized into rows and column.
# All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints.

# SQL - Structured Query Language is the language we use to issue commands to the databse
# Create a table
# Retrieve some data
# Insert data
# Delete data
# Update data

# Python cleans up the data
# SQL great way to store and retrieve data
