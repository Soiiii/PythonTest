# Database Design
# Database design is an art form of its own with particular skiils and experience
# Our goal is to avoid the really bad mistakes and design clean and easily understood database
# Others may performance tune things later
# Database design starts with a picture

# Building a Data Model
# Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and
# their relationships
# Basic Rule: Don't put the same sting data in twice - use a relationship instead
# When there is one thing in the "real world" there should be one copy of that thing in the database
