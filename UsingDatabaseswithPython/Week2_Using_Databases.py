# Two Roles in Large Projects
# Application Developer - Builds the logic for the application, the look and feel of the application
# - monitors the application for problems

# Database Administrator - Monitor and adjusts the databases as the program runs in production
# Often both people participate in the building of the "Data Model"

# Database Model
# A database model or database schema is the structure or format of a database,
# described in a formal language supported by the database management system.
# In other words, a "database model" is the application of a data model when used in conjunction
# with a database management system.

# Common Database Systems
# Oracle - Large, commercial, enterprise-scale, very very tweakable -> enterprise
# MySql - Simpler but very fast and scalable - commercial open source -> website
# SqlServer -ver nice from Microsoft(Also Access)
# Postgres - similar to Oracle
# SqlLite - small, goes in to the application, fast -> python import
