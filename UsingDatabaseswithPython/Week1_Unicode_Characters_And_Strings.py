#Representing Simple Strings
#Each character is reprsented by a number betwenn 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory
# We refer to "8 bits of memory as a "byte" of memory - (i.e. my disk drive contains 3 Terabytes of memory)
# The ord() function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character

print(ord('H')) #72
print(ord('e')) #101
print(ord('\n')) #10
